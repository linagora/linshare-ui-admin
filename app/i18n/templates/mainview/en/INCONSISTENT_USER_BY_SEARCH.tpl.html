<p><strong>User diagnostic</strong></p>
<p>For a given email address, this view shows a full report of the matching user on his presence
  in the LDAP with the associated domain and also in the database. So this view is useful when testing if a user is in
  the right domain or if he belongs to multiple domains in the same time, etc ...
</p>

<p>Furthermore, in this view you can show all related information to a user and edit them such as changing the user's
  domain to another.
